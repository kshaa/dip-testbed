# DIP Testbed
The mantra in this project is "first make it work, refactor later (maybe)"

_N.B.: This repository has two instances (**public** and **private**)_  
_N.B.: The private repository contains the source code_  
_N.B.: The public repository contains only prototypes and documentation_  
_N.B.: So don't be surprised when seeing broken links and references in the public repository_
